                <h2>Code of Conduct for the SUPERRR Community</h2>
                <h3>1.‭ ‬Purpose</h3>
                <p>A‭ ‬primary‭ ‬goal‭ ‬of‭ ‬SUPERRR ‬is‭ ‬to‭ ‬be‭ ‬inclusive‭ ‬to‭ ‬the‭ ‬largest‭ ‬number‭ ‬of‭ ‬contributors‭ ‬with‭ ‬the‭ ‬most‭ ‬varied‭ ‬and‭ ‬diverse‭ ‬backgrounds‭ ‬possible.‭ ‬As‭ ‬such,‭ ‬we‭ ‬are‭ ‬committed‭ ‬to‭ ‬providing‭ ‬a‭ ‬friendly,‭ ‬safe‭ ‬and‭ ‬welcoming‭ ‬environment.‭
                    This‭ ‬code‭ ‬of‭ ‬conduct‭ ‬outlines‭ ‬our‭ ‬expectations‭ ‬for‭ ‬all‭ ‬those‭ ‬who‭ ‬participate‭ ‬in‭ ‬our‭ ‬community,‭ ‬as‭ ‬well‭ ‬as‭ ‬the‭ ‬consequences‭ ‬for‭ ‬unacceptable‭ ‬behaviour.
                    We‭ ‬invite‭ ‬all‭ ‬those‭ ‬who‭ ‬participate‭ ‬in‭ SUPERRR ‬to‭ ‬help‭ ‬us‭ ‬create‭ ‬safe‭ ‬and‭ ‬positive‭ ‬experiences‭ ‬for‭ ‬everyone.
                </p>
                <p>Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.
                  We build trust in our community by making it invite-only, asking existing attendees to invite others they think would benefit from the meetups/Slack channel bringing positive contributions.</p>
