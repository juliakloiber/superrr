<h2>DING Issue 7</h2>
<h1>Big Tech's Success: The Untold Exploitation of African Workers</h1>
<p><i>“It's heartening to know our voices are being heard and amplified.”</i></p>
<p> For the first time, social media content moderators from Kenya tell their own stories, unfiltered and raw. In our magazine's most recent issue, thirteen of them give us a glimpse into the harsh realities of their work.</p>

<p>To keep us safe, they act as buffers, filtering graphic, explicit content to protect our feeds, sacrificing their own safety and well-being. Despite precarious conditions and ongoing struggles, they refuse to see themselves as victims. Instead, they are organizing for better rights.</p>

<p>Their names are: Sonia, Koffi, Mojez, Kauna, Pacific, Mophat, Kings, Daniel, and Nathan.</p>

<p><i>I watched these videos constantly until I could no longer bear it. [...] My attempts to describe how the videos affected my relationship with my children fell on deaf ears.”</i> – A mother writes about how this job negatively affected her relationship with her children.</p>

<p><i>“AI cannot be ethical if it is trained immorally.”</i> –  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mophat-okinyi/">Mophat Okinyi</a>, a former content moderator for OpenAI, speaks about the human cost of AI.</p>

<p><i>“In countries like Kenya, where an educated workforce faces chronic unemployment [...] forcing many talented young graduates into the digital economy.”</i> –  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nerimawako/">Martha Nerima Selina Wako</a>, from the nonprofit <a href="https://siasaplace.com/">Siasa Place</a>, writes about the silence of Kenyan politicians about the risks and perils involved in digital work.</p>

<p><i>“And then you had women having miscarriages. Women started losing weight, becoming unkempt... so many things. For the most part, the violence we saw was against women – intimate partner violence, women being stabbed.”</i> – <a hreff= "https://www.linkedin.com/in/kauna-malgwi-104b5b86/">Kauna Malgwi</a> writes about the hidden toll on women in content moderation.</p>
