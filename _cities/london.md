Come by, grab a drink, hang out with like-minded women* who challenge the status quo. 

Superrr is a community of female, trans and non-binary people in the arts, in science, tech, journalism, activism and more.

We strive for diversity, fairness and equality. We believe that we can best achieve that by working together and by empowering and supporting one another. We meet on a regular basis to have a good time, exchange new ideas and scheme on new collaborations.


<b>About the hosts:</b>

<a href="https://codekat.net/">Kat Braybrooke</a> is a digital anthropologist, designer & co-founder of <a href="https://studiowe.net/">Studiõ Wê & Üs</a> who studies the dynamics of creative communities, from hackers to crafters, across physical and virtual terrains. In particular, this work explores how collective spaces (from museums and libraries to makerspaces) can harness cultural heritage in ways that foster social and ecological transformation, and how collective action can enable “hacks”, or alternatives to the status quo.

She is currently a public-interest Tech Policy Fellow at the Mozilla Foundation. Previously, she was the Director of the Corporate Exploitation Programme at Privacy International.
