Come by, grab a drink, hang out with like-minded women* who challenge the status quo. 

Superrr is a community of female, trans and non-binary people in the arts, in science, tech, journalism, activism and more.

We strive for diversity, fairness and equality. We believe that we can best achieve that by working together and by empowering and supporting one another. We meet on a regular basis to have a good time, exchange new ideas and scheme on new collaborations.

No agenda. No men*. No bullshit. ;) 

Invite only.
