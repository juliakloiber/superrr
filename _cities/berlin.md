Superrr is a community of female, trans and non-binary people in the arts, in science, tech, journalism, activism and more.

Come by, grab a drink, hang out with like-minded folks and bring a friend to diversify our crowd! People from various backgrounds (art, science, tech, music ... whatever floats your boat!) meet at a bar to chat, exchange ideas and to just have a nice evening together.

Please feel free to bring a +1 to extend the group.
