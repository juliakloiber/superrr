We are currently exploring how to make working on the principles as accessible as possible. One possible format will be online/offline collective writing and discussion workshops.
The principles are open for debate and editing, and we welcome critical and productive feedback. <br>
<br>
Soon you'll be able to help us develop them further by leaving your comments and ideas in our Github repository. If you are interested in sending direct feedback or talking to us about the principles, please write us an email: hello@superrr.net <br>
<br>
If you would like to get updates on the process and be invited to future workshops please sign up to [this mailing list](https://superrrr.us18.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=07794224f80eb3988af949760&id=2b1b3a01e0).
