title: How are the principles interconnected? How are they distinguished?
order: 5

Among many other thinkers, writers, activists and technologists, the Feminist Tech Principles are inspired by Valerie Hannon's concept of the _Four Levels of Thriving_, at which education must be rethought so that people can thrive. The levels are: global, societal, interpersonal, and intrapersonal (we use "the self"). In that each level influences the others reciprocally, they are interdependent. We believe this is not only true for education but can be applied to the creation of technology or its regulation. <br>
<br>
On the one hand, we want to use this method to examine existing challenges and relate them to each other. On the other we are aiming at an holistic approach towards the contemporary and future creation and regulation of technologies. What shifts follow from thinking through technology creation or policymaking and thier impacts at each of the four levels? <br>
<br>
Many of the principles are interdependent and affect more than one level. We have placed each principle at the level upon which we found its impact to be particularly strong. <br>
