We are currently exploring how to make working on the principles as accessible as possible. One possible format will be online/offline collective writing and discussion workshops.
The principles are open for debate and editing, and we welcome critical and productive feedback. Please help us develop them further and leave your comments and ideas in our Github repository. If you would like to get updates on the process and be invited to future workshops please sign up to the following mailing list. If you are interested in talking to us about the principles, please write us an email: hello@superrr.net
