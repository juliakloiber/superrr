We are standing on the shoulders of giantesses. Our work builds upon the work of many people and groups before us. The principles that we have developed are only a snapshot, created by a particular set of people with particular perspectives, experiences, privileges and marginalisations.<br>
<br>
For our contributors and for us, these principles and guidelines have been especially inspirational:<br>
