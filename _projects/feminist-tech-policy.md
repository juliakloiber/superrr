<p>
Whether speaking of artificial intelligence, facial recognition, credit-scoring or social-scoring – today’s digital technologies already disadvantage marginalised groups. One reason for this biased pattern of impact is that representatives of marginalized groups are not sufficiently involved in the tech industry nor in policy discussions on technology. As a result, their experiences in dealing with discriminatory technologies are too seldom heard by decision-makers and direct influence on the creation process of new technologies is hardly possible.
</p>
<p>
If these patterns do not change in a sustainable and broad-based way, digital technologies will continue to contribute to injustice and, as they become increasingly important, will further entrench and exacerbate that injustice.
</p>
<p>
We are developing the first feminist tech policy framework that serves a diverse society. Our approach is inspired by the Feminist Foreign Policy, which was introduced by governments in several countries.
</p>
<p>
Technology which is considered from a narrow or single perspective leads to unrepresentative regulation and the reinforcement of existing intersectional injustices. Current digitisation narratives are economic in nature and serve the interests of corporations over societies and minorities. By contrast, feminist tech policy takes a holistic view to examine digitisation in terms of intersectional patterns of discrimination.
</p>
<p>
Our practical policy recommendations will positively influence political discourse on technology development. In order to ensure the feasibility of recommendations, we will obtain input from leading European experts from politics, civil society and business.

The feminist tech policy framework is supported by the program <a href="https://www.bosch-stiftung.de/en/project/support-program-reducing-inequalities-through-intersectional-practice/supported-projects">Reducing Inequalities Through Intersectional Practice</a> of Robert Bosch Stiftung.
