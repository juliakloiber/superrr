<p>What kind of world do we want to live in? And what do just, diverse and inclusive visions of the digital future look like if we dare to explore new ways of thinking? The <a href="https://risktakers.space/">Risktakers Fellowship</a> aims to explore possibilities and what-ifs that enable us to re-imagine the status quo through a wide range of voices and perspectives, in the digital world and beyond. </p>

<p>The Risktakers Fellowship kicked off on December 5th, 2023 and will be working with ten fellows over the course of eight months.</p>

<p>“The Risktakers Fellowship – Daring to shape new digital futures” is a fellowship programme by Allianz Foundation and SUPERRR Lab.
