<p>The feminist tech fellows are artists, writers, activists, technologists, creatives – who set out to explore alternative digital futures. Futures in which safe, equitable participation in the connected world is the norm. Futures in which people of all genders and cultural backgrounds are supported to influence and create tools and concepts for digital interactions.</p>

<h2>Demanding Inclusive And Radically Diverse Digital Futures</h2>
<p>With the fellowships we strive to explore new narratives that counter dominant big tech visions. We want to speculate what feminist technologies look like and come up with tools that help us to challenge existing patterns and to embrace diversity. We want to shine a light on people who develop those projects and get insights into their approaches.</p>
