<h3> Feminist Tech Policy</h3>

<p>

We at SUPERRR Lab are convinced: Digital policy needs to be understood as social policy as it addresses social issues such as accessibility, active participation, sustainability and equity.
This requires an intersectional feminist approach to focus on those societal groups that are most affected by the negative consequences of digitisation. <br>Feminist digital policy stands for a paradigm shift:
away from “higher, faster, further” to “more sustainable, equitable, people-centred”.
<br><br>
SUPERRR has been working on feminist perspectives on tech since our inception in 2019 and for example developed the 
<a href="https://superrr.net/feministtech/principles/"> feminist tech principles</a>.

In 2022 we started a dedicated project on feminist tech policy, working to introduce feminist perspectives in politics and administration in Berlin, Brussels, and beyond.

<p>

Our website <a href="https://feministtechpolicy.org/">feministtechpolicy.org</a> is one of the ways we are taking part in shaping feminist tech policy, as the fundamental understanding of what feminist digital policy means specifically is still lacking. This is what our website is for: an active repository for all issues involving feminist digital policy. We will continuously add new case studies and resources to keep this theme up to date.
