<h1>Building Inclusive and Diverse Digital Futures</h1>
<p>The New New aims to be a place for exchange, exploration and creation where current systems and practices can be reimagined. Rather than focusing on techno-solutionist narratives or technology’s economic opportunities, social values are at the heart of the discussion. The New New will kick off with a Europe-wide fellowship program: In 2021, we will support the work of artists, technologists, writers, designers and others in exploring what inclusive and just digital futures look like. This project is a collaboration with the Ethics of Algorithms Program. The program is a staring point for discussions and experiments.

<p>
The New New is a joint program by the Bertelsmann Stiftung’s “Ethics of Algorithms” project and Superrr Lab. Fellowship funds are awarded by the Bertelsmann Stiftung.
