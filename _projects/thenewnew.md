<h1>Building Inclusive and Diverse Digital Futures</h1>
<p>The New New is a program startet in 2019. It aims to be a place for exchange, exploration and creation where current systems and practices can be reimagined. Rather than focusing on techno-solutionist narratives or technology’s economic opportunities, social values are at the heart of the discussion. The New New kicked off with a Europe-wide fellowship program and supported 12 projects by artists, technologists, writers & designers.</p>
 
<p>
The supported projects range from <a href="https://thenewnew.space/projects/algorithms-of-late-capitalism-the-card-game/">co-creative card games</a>, to <a href="https://thenewnew.space/projects/multivocal/">the redesign of voice assistants</a> and new speculative formats to draft <a href="https://thenewnew.space/projects/la-banlieue-du-turfu/">progressive futures for urban environments</a>. The fellowship received over 300 applications and is likely to be continued in 2022.
</p>

<p>
The New New is a joint program by the Bertelsmann Stiftung’s “Ethics of Algorithms” project and Superrr Lab in cooperation with The Goethe Institute and Allianz Kulturstiftung.
