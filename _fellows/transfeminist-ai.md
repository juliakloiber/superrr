<p>The Oracle for transfeminist technologies aims to make the deabates on algorithmic bias, the role of AI, and other crucial conversations accessible to wider audiences  through a speculative codesign game.</p>

<p>Most of the algorithms commanding our digital interactions are biased and help maintain the norms of a consumerist, misogynist, racist, ableist, gender binary, and heteropatriarchal society. In our project we invite people to radically re-imagine what AI could look like if built around transfeminist values.</p>

<p>Inspired by the use of divination procedures as technologies to understand the present and reshape the future, our goal is to develop a set of divination cards embedded with transfeminist values as an Oracle to guide us towards envisioning transfeminist AIs.</p>

<p>The Feminist Tech Fellowship will support us to elaborate both the card deck used in the game and to brainstorm around a prototype repository of ideas for transfeminist technologies that emerge while people envision speculative futures by playing the deck. The repository will be set in a futuristic scenery, where these technologies are already established and broadly available, therefore accessible to shift realities. We hope that this narrative will help us foresee a better future where AIs are co-designed with people who are too often excluded from or targeted by technology in today's world.</p>
