Maya Ober is a Jewish-diasporic designer, researcher, educator, activist, and more. Unsettled about the character of dominant design practices, in 2017, Maya founded depatriarchise design, looking at connecting feminist activism with design. Currently, Maya co-directs Futuress – a feminist platform for design politics – alongside her longtime friend and collaborator Nina Paim.  As the Swiss National Science Foundation grantee, Maya works as a doctoral researcher at the Institute of Social Anthropology, University of Bern in Switzerland. Her research looks at feminist practices of design education and their intersections with activist movements.
Located in Basel, Switzerland, from January 2022 Buenos Aires, Argentina <br>
