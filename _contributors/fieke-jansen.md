Fieke Jansen is a Ph.D. candidate at the Data Justice Lab at Cardiff University. The Data Justice Lab examines the intricate relationship between datafication and social justice, highlighting the politics and impacts of data-driven processes and big data. Jansen is interested in re-politicizing data and technology, by understanding its historical, social, cultural, and political context in Europe. Her research focuses on the impact of implementing data driven decision-making in European police forces on marginalized communities. Prior to starting her Ph.D., she worked at Tactical Tech, a Berlin based NGO, as the project lead for their Politics of Data program. There she developed educational materials, engaged in data literacy efforts, and engaged in research. Before Tactical Tech, Jansen worked at the Hivos, a Dutch development organization, on several programs at the intersection of human rights, internet, and freedom of expression.
