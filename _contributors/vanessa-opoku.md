Vanessa A. Opoku is a visual artist and lives and works in Berlin. She recently graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts Leipzig and studied at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna and the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design Jerusalem. With film and photography, animation, 3D scans and AI, she explores the borderlands of mixed reality. Traces that people leave behind become visible between the worlds of virtuality and physical reality. Beings and objects turn into mediating mentors who ask questions and tell stories of identity and self-empowerment.<br>
