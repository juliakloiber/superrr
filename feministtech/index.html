                        Contemporary digitisation narratives are economic in nature and serve the interests of corporations over the needs of societies and minorities. By contrast, feminist tech policy takes a holistic view of digitisation, to look at it in terms of intersectional patterns of discrimination. By taking a feminist approach we are able to think and see beyond existing stories and structures. We question current innovation narratives and examine the value of maintenance, accessibility, openness and care for the digital societies of the future.

                        The core element of the Feminist Tech Framework is a card deck that helps players engage in discussions about feminist tech in a fun way while drawing upon their own experiences and visions.

                <p class="text-center">
                    The Feminist Tech principles are a set of guidelines for tech policy-making and technology creation. They are intended as a responsive work-in-progress that reflect the evolving nature of our digital world. The principles were drafted in a collaborative process between the team at SUPERRR Lab and a group of activists, policymakers, writers, designers, technologists, researchers and educators, that advocate for digital rights and the rights of marginalised groups.
                </p>
                <p class="text-center">
                    These principles take a critical lens to tech, observing and addressing the power structures behind the creation, regulation and use of technology, and offering a framework for creating new, emancipatory structures.

                    To make the Feminist Tech Principles more tangible and accessible to a wider audience, our contributors and us turn to storytelling by developing a set of future narratives. They aim to envision more just technological futures based on selected Principles.
