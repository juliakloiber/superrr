                        Technology that is considered from a narrow or single perspective leads to unrepresentative regulation and the reinforcement of existing intersectional injustices. By analyzing tech through a feminist gaze, we begin to see the ways in which white, capitalist, patriarchal, and colonialist structures work together and influence tech processes. These principles look at tech through a critical lens, observing and addressing the power structures behind technology creation, regulation, and use, and offering a framework for creating otherwise.

                    The Feminist Tech principles are a work in progress set of guidelines for feminist tech policy-making and technology creation. They have been drafted by various people SUPERRR Lab has invited into the process; activists, policymakers, writers, designers, technologists, researchers, and educators, that advocate for digital rights and the rights of marginalized groups.

                    Each principle is supported by insights into the status quo, a brief overview on why we think the principle is necessary, and a good practice example of people or organizations who are already working on this topic in a feminist way. To make the topic more tangible and accessible to a wider audience, we turn to storytelling by developing a set of future narratives for some of the principles, with the aim to expand further.

                    To create the feminist tech principles, visions, and the card deck, we worked together with activists, policymakers, writers, designers, technologists, researchers, and educators, that advocate for digital rights and the rights of marginalized groups.
