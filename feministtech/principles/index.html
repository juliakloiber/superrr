                        The Feminist Tech principles are a set of guidelines for tech policy-making and technology creation. They are intended as responsive work-in-progress that reflect the evolving nature of our digital world. The principles were drafted in a collaborative process between the team at SUPERRR Lab and a group of activists, policymakers, writers, designers, technologists, researchers, and educators, that advocate for digital rights and the rights of marginalized groups.

                    <p>
                        Each principle is supported by insights into the status quo, why the principle is necessary, and a good practice example of people or organisations already working on the topic in a feminist way. To ensure the topics are tangible and accessible to a wide audience, weâ€™ve turned to storytelling and future narratives for some of the principles, with the aim of expanding further.
