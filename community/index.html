            <p class="intro-text">Superrr is a community of cis and trans women, trans men, and non-binary people in the arts, in science, tech, journalism, activism and more. People who challenge the status quo by the work they do â€“ through starting new programs and organisations, running campaigns, creating community spaces or developing and building things that try to make the world a better place.

                We strive for diversity, fairness and equality. We believe that we can best achieve that by working together and by empowering and supporting one another.

                We meet on a regular basis to come together, exchange new ideas and scheme on new collaborations. We combine our forces to fight for a free society in which everyone can live up to their potentials.
                <br><br>
                The Superrr community was started in 2015 by Zara Rahman and Julia Kloiber. Kat Braybrooke, Christine Jakobson and Frederike Kaltheuner run the Superrr community in London.
