<p>We love our projects - but translating their results into actionable policy demands and proposals is a lengthy process. Playing this long game is a challenge for most non-profits, and it definitely has been a challenge for us. We are therefore excited to announce that we received support to strengthen the advocacy and policy work of SUPERRR Lab! </p>
  
<p>Our policy work builds on the organisationâ€™s past, current and upcoming projects at the intersection of digital technology, gender equality and anti-racism. We will use the grant in 2022 to develop a mid-term advocacy strategy for an intersectional feminist tech policy that is built on values such as consent, care, and co-creation, and reframes digital and tech policy as a genuinely societal and social issue.</p>

<p>The intersectional feminist tech policy will become a core program of SUPERRR: It builds on our networks, our projects and our research like our <a href="https://superrr.net/feministtech/">Feminist Tech Principles</a>, and gathers our findings and recommendations for policy-makers under one roof. It is also a shared endeavour: We will partner with social and racial justice organisations and other organisations from digital civil society.</p>

<p> While much of SUPERRR's policy work is focused on Germany, the intertwined nature of national and European policy-making means that our policy can also be used in an international context.</p>

<p>Expect to see more policy proposals, public debates and overall: more SUPERRR all around!</p>

<p>Supported by a grant from the Open Society Foundation gGmbH in cooperation with the OSIFE of the Open Society Foundations.</p>
