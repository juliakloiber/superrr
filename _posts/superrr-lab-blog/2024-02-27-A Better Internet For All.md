<p><b>About the host organization:</b> </p>
<p>Accessibility Lab is a Mexican organization that was born in 2017 seeking to ensure the inclusion of people with disabilities and their integral development, through accessibility in the digital world. We believe the best policy to have an accessible world is to guide, teach and help digital content creators on their journey to become accessible and inclusive. That way they will learn and understand the importance of design and develop accessible solutions and they will take that awareness and knowledge with them wherever they go. At the end, accessible tools/products will have the best quality anyone can have and with that everyone’s chance to use it, including people with disabilities. </p>
