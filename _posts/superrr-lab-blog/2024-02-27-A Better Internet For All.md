<p><b>About the host organization:</b> </p>
<p>Accessibility Lab is a Mexican organization that was born in 2017 seeking to ensure the inclusion of people with disabilities and their integral development, through accessibility in the digital world. We believe the best policy to have an accessible world is to guide, teach and help digital content creators on their journey to become accessible and inclusive. That way they will learn and understand the importance of design and develop accessible solutions and they will take that awareness and knowledge with them wherever they go. At the end, accessible tools/products will have the best quality anyone can have and with that everyone’s chance to use it, including people with disabilities. </p>

<p><b>A Better Internet For All</b> </p>

<p>The ability of all users, including those with impairments, to perceive, comprehend, navigate, 
and engage with websites and tools is known as web accessibility. Several accessibility 
guidelines assist a wider user base than simply just those with impairments. For instance, one 
such example is a higher color contrast, which is advantageous to anyone using the platform in 
either very bright or very dark circumstances. Features like captions can help in noisy 
environments, not just for those with hearing impairments. Web accessibility therefore helps not 
just the individual but also platform owners and larger society. </p>

<p><b>Training Agenda:</b> </p>

<p>Provide in-person training to staff members and other related people in the organisation that 
created and manage their applications (UX designers, developers, structural designers, trainers, 
etc.) about the importance of digital accessibility and Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.2. 
Also inviting other contributing member orgs and other related people that worked towards 
building or working in anti-surveillance technology and open-source software, that actively 
contribute to this project.</p>
