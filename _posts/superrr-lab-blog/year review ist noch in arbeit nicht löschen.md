<p>
As we move forward into the new year, it's important to take a moment to reflect on the past and recognize the progress we've made, which wouldn't have been possible without the support of our SUPERRR communities! In this blog post, we've decided to invite you to take a closer look at some of our events and achievements of 2022.</p>

<p><b>Muslim Futures</b><p>

Last year, we proudly announced "Muslim Futures", a project that imagines a space in which joy, love, community and empowerment are centered on a Muslim positionality.
Our seven futurists have been working together to create and imagine inclusive, fair and just visions of Muslim Futures. They are implementing projects from artistic, cultural, political and inter/anti-disciplinary approaches into practice.
If you are curious about the futurists, upcoming events and special occasions, make sure to check out

<p>After dropping hints throughout the year, we were finally able to reveal and launch one of our superrrr-secret projects in December: The Risktakers Fellowship!
The Risktakers project aims to create a space for fellows to dream, plan and explore the possibilities to reimagine the status quo in the digital world and beyond. We received 900 applications and are currently heads-down in the review phase. You can stay up to date on <a href="https://risktakers.space">the website</a> and sign up for the Risktakers newsletter <a href="https://space.us7.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=0357d29dc2e41ff0157fda5f4&id=5d9d37864f">here</a>.</p>

<p>Upcoming in 2023: Announcement of the Fellows in March</p>

<p>In September 2022, civil society organisations, researchers, and activists from around the world gathered in Berlin for the Digital Futures Gathering. During the event, participants discussed, planned, and dreamed of sustainable, just, feminist, and decolonial digital futures.
The <a href="https://digitalfutures.space/"> documentation website</a> is full of recommendations, wishes and deep dives that you should not miss. A list of all the participants can be found on the website. We thank everyone who was part of the gathering!</p>

<p><b>Feminist Tech Policy</b></p>

<p>Throughout 2022, we started developing a theoretical framework for a feminist approach to tech policy, which critically analyses existing power relations and works towards establishing justice. It requires an intersectional feminist lens focusing on social groups most affected by digitalisation's negative consequences. 
<a href="https://feministtechpolicy.org/">We created a living repository</a> for all things feminist tech policy with the latest analyses and takes on current policy developments such as CSA regulation. Stay up to date on new case studies through our <a href="https://buttondown.email/FeministischeDigitalpolitik“>newsletter</a>.</p>

<p>As part of the Feminist Foreign Policy Summit of the CFFP, we had an excellent discussion with Alexandra Geese and Dr Nakeema Stefflbauer on what a feminist digital policy can look like – and what we can learn from the adoption of feminist foreign policy frameworks. <a href="https://youtu.be/WaJdh7DJwVc">Rewatch here.</a></p>

<p><b>SUPERRR Lab joins German Digital Strategy Advisory Board</b></p>
<p>We're proudly announcing that Julia Kloiber joined the Advisory board for Digital Strategy which meets up monthly and consists of 19 members from the areas of science, economy, and civil society. Learn more <a href="https://digitalstrategie-deutschland.de/beirat/">here.</a></p>

<p><b>SUPERRR Community</b><p>
<p>Due to the pandemic, our SUPERRR community had to move into a more digital realm to keep in touch. Still, there was an effort and need to meet up outside of digital spaces, and when possible, we tried to make it a reality.</p>

<p><b>Self-Love and Carbs</b></p>

<p>We kicked the spring off with "Self-love and Carbs" - a culinary self-defence class for cis and trans-women, trans men and non-binary folx, which was designed to give all participants some extra resources that will come in handy when navigating a patriarchal, cis-hetero-normative world every day. We thank Eva Dingel from <a href="https://yanagi.berlin/">Yanagi Jutaijutsu Berlin e.V</a> and Abir Ghattas for creating this joint event with us!</p>
