<p><em>We are very excited to announce a new addition to our team! Zara will step us as our Strategic Advisor and help develop and improve the ways we can reach our goals ✨ To introduce and welcome her, we've asked a couple of questions: </em></p>

<p><b>SUPERRR:</b> A good way to get to know someone is via their side projects and hobbies. What are some of your current side projects, Zara?
</p>
<p><b>Zara:</b> The side projects that take up the most of my time are my two small children! They’re a very rewarding project though, haha. And my dream/ambitious side project is actually related to them: together with a friend I’m slowly working on an idea for a children’s book series, which explains key concepts to children in an interesting and fun way, from an abolitionist perspective. Other past times include reading –  I keep a semi-regular track of my favourite books over on Storygraph https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/zararah  –  and having people over for dinner, I love having a big busy dinner table!</p>

<p><b>SUPERRR:</b> With Superrr Lab we are thinking a lot about the future(s). What is an object/or application that does not yet exist – but something that you would like to have at your disposal in a preferable digital future? Something you would use every day and cannot imagine living without?
</p>
<p><b>Zara:</b> This is perhaps part of the very point of memories being fleeting and special –  but I would love something to properly capture all sensory feelings of a particular point in time, so you can revisit them later on. More than just a photo, it would be something that can properly transport you back to a particular moment –  the smells, the feelings, the view, everything. 
</p>
  
<p><b>SUPERRR:</b> What's your biggest energy sucker these days?</p>

<p><b>Zara:</b> I’m not sure if this is really an energy sucker or just a constant pain and disappointment, but global politics –  specifically, the way in which the world is watching Palestine and now Lebanon be occupied and treated so unnecessarily violently, and watching global governance mechanisms fail so completely. </p>

<p><b>SUPERRR:</b> What is a small humble change you would like to see in the world? How can we work towards it?</p>

<p><b>Zara:</b> So many of the bigger changes I’d like to see in the world seem to start from a very basic one: being kind to your neighbours and those around you, and having compassion for whatever they’re going through, and being there for them. I feel like if we all started there, a lot of good and necessary things could ripple outwards.</p>

<p><b>SUPERRR:</b> Things we should all read/know about! Please share some of your favorite projects, texts, links, inspirations with us:
</p>

<p><b>Zara:</b> 
<ul><li>My dear friend and feminist activist Subha just published this fantastic report, on fascist and fundamentalist narratives in South Asia and Southeast Asia regions –  https://wearenoor.org/roots-of-hate-ssea/ </li>

<li>One of my favourite hopeful projects for the future is the Numun Fund –  https://numun.fund/ –  I’m on the review committee for grants and reading through the applications gives me so so much hope and inspiration!</li>

<li>I love Mimi’s work for many reasons, but in this case, for articulating so eloquently a concept – the “unknowable”–   in a way that makes me rethink the way I think about things: https://www.e-flux.com/architecture/spatial-computing/593493/the-end-of-a-world-as-we-knew-it/</li></ul>


<p><b>SUPERRR:</b> Last but not least, what's your favourite Meme?</p>
<p><b>Zara:</b> ‘be honest’ has been all over my Instagram since their documentary came out! 
</p>
