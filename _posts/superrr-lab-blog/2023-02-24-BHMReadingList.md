Black History Month is a time to celebrate the achievements and recognise the contributions of Black visionaries who have shaped history and had a lasting impact on our societies. However, it's important to remember that their legacy should be honoured and their stories elevated beyond just one month a year. Consequently, it's essential to turn to books and literature to learn about and amplify the voices of Black authors, activists, and thinkers who are shaping our conversations on race, gender and class.</p>
