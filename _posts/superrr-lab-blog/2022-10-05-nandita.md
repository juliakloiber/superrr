<p><em>We are very excited to announce a new addition to our team! ✨ Nandita will lead a new and currently superrr secret project we'll publicly launch in December. While the details about this are still under lock and key, we asked Nandita a few questions about herself:</em></p>

<p><b>SUPERRR:</b> A good way to get to know someone is via their side projects and hobbies. What are some of your current side projects, Nandita?</p>
<p><b>Nandita:</b> One of my main projects besides my exciting new job at SUPERRR is my voluntary work which is about to start soon. I recently completed my training as a certified coach and mediator and will be working for a feminist organization who offer consultation and coaching for women* free of charge. I've wanted to do this kind of work since forever so I'm really happy that I finally have the training and opportunity to do so. Since autumn has started and it's getting all dark and comfy I'm also working on various design and sewing projects. Sitting on my old and indestructible Pfaff machine while listening to audiobooks or podcasts is one of my favorite me time activities – especially when I've been in my head for too long. And I've been stepping up my sports game training a lot of Muay Thai but also dancing (swing) and swimming. </p>

<p><b>SUPERRR:</b> With Superrr Lab we are thinking a lot about the future(s). What is an object/or application that does not yet exist – but something that you would like to have at your disposal in a preferable digital future?
Something you would use every day and cannot imagine living without?
</p>
<p><b>Nandita:</b> I would love a <i>what I actually meant</i> translation device or program. Human communication and interaction is so tricky and to me it seems that a lot of people don't have access to their emotions and actual needs not to mention the proper words for it. Even or maybe because this kind of application would make us all more permeable and vulnerable I think it would really improve the way we live and care for each other.</p>
  
<p><b>SUPERRR:</b> What's your biggest energy sucker these days?</p>

<p><b>Nandita:</b> Darkness and coldness are super hard for me so Berlin winter lowers my energy level disastrously (How about we work on the Canary Islands in February, Superrr humans?) Besides that I find it really exhausting when people or institutions don't want to move or change even though the necessity is super obvious. </p>

<p><b>SUPERRR:</b> What is a small humble change you would like to see in the world? How can we work towards it?</p>

<p><b>Nandita:</b> Being kinder and more cautious with each other, accepting ambiguities and questioning ourselves and the conditions we live in – at least from time to time – seem like a good and realistic way to start. To me it feels that Superrr is already doing a great job with that not only in terms of content but also on an organizational and personal level. </p>

<p><b>SUPERRR:</b> What communities are you part of?</p>

<p><b>Nandita:</b> There are quite a few communities I feel close to and – similar to Quincey – for me this feeling of belonging and like-mindedness is not static but a process. The one big constant for sure is feminism and therefore various feminist communities I feel connected to. But I'm also involved in academic as well as artistic circles. </p>

<p><b>SUPERRR:</b> What are things we should all read/know about? Please share three of your favorite projects, texts, links, inspirations with us:</p>

<p><b>Nandita:</b> I recently discovered a really beautiful series adaption of Sally Rooney's novel Normal People. It affected me even more than the book and has a really intimate but not voyeuristic approach on human relationships. Olivia Laing's text The Lonely City – Adventures in the Art of Being Alone which I read during the peak of the covid pandemic felt really unique and striking. It's kind of an art-historical discourse regarding the various conditions of loneliness intertwined with the personal thoughts and experiences of the author. And I'm still amazed of how simple and and yet concise Maja Göpel can explain complex conditions and issues. I especially enjoyed the interview with her at Hotel Matze because it felt way more personal than her other interviews or texts. </p>

<p><b>SUPERRR:</b> Last but not least, what's your favourite Meme?</p>
<p><b>Nandita:</b> I'd rather share a <a href="https://tenor.com/view/jodie-comer-yes-nailed-it-cheering-killing-eve-gif-17295762">gif</a> with you (btw: if you haven't watched Killing Eve yet you should definitely do so because it's crazy and genius and fun)</p>

<p><b>SUPERRR:</b> Thank you so much Nandita! We're so looking forward to working with you!</p>
