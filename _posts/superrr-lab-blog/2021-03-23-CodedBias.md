<p><h3>About "Coded Bias"</h3></p>

Synopsis: Modern society sits at the intersection of two crucial questions: What does it mean when artificial intelligence increasingly governs our liberties? And what are the consequences for the people AI is biased against? When MIT Media Lab researcher Joy Buolamwini discovers that most facial-recognition software does not accurately identify darker-skinned faces and the faces of women, she delves into an investigation of widespread bias in algorithms. As it turns out, artificial intelligence is not neutral, and women are leading the charge to ensure our civil rights are protected.

Coded Bias premiered at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival, and follows researchers and advocates as they explore how algorithms encode and propagate bias.

The discussion will kick off with three short inputs by netzforma, Motif and Superrr Lab.
The organizations will highlight some of the work they have been doing in the field. Netzforma and Motif recently published a book about feminist AI and Superrr (together with Lorena Jaume-Palasi) wrote a reserch paper on AI in recruiting processes and gender discrimination.

After the inputs we will engage in a discussion with the audience.
