We are superrr happy to have been able to host a panel on intersectional feminist approaches to tech policy at this years <a href="https://re-publica.com/de/session/sorry-late-reply-feminist-lessons-digital-frontier/">re:publica</a>. We were specifically thrilled to bring together four amazing women in one panel who talked about the impact of feminist practices on tech development, how a feminist perspective can help to build a better internet and how we all can move forward with our struggles to create more inclusive and equitable digital futures. We were able to welcome on stage Hera Hussein, the founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.chayn.co/">Chayn</a>, a civil society organization fighting gender-based violence. Moreover we were joined by <a href="https://michellethorne.cc/about/">Michelle Thorne</a>, research director of Mozzilla’s sustainability program, as well as by <a href="https://re-publica.com/de/user/12575/">Ellen Ehmke</a>), a senior expert on inequality at the Robert Bosch Foundation. The session was moderated by our very own <a href="https://juliakloiber.com/">Julia Kloiber</a>) from SUPERRR Lab.

 From the very beginning on it became apparent that in technology issues, as in all other areas, different systems of oppression such as patriarchy, racism, socioeconomic inequality, etc. intersect and shape the world we live in as well as our individual experiences in it. The panelists highlighted the incredible intersectional feminist tradition and heritage we all draw upon in our daily work to change technologies and the internet for the better.

<b>“We're all standing on the shoulders of giant*esses - today we're here to share their and our stories and to celebrate".</b> - Julia Kloiber
</p>
<p>
Viewing how technology has transformed the world today, we need this strong tradition to build on, because tech transformations have been far from picture-perfect. Technology has brought opportunities, efficiencies and innovations. But at the same time it has entrenched inequalities, polarised debates and created novel harms. Activists around the globe are working on bringing feminist values like collaboration, care, and equity to the center of technology development aiming to disrupt and change the power structures of big tech.
</p>

<p>
Incorporating feminist values in ones everyday work and approach to life is definitely an experiment, as Hera Hussein pointed out. Having built an organization on the basis of collaboration and openness, she learned that “feminism is not a goal post or a destination, you are learning and unlearning all the time”, which also means sometimes “being just another imperfect feminist.” But using your own power to create spaces for oneself and others means continuous learning about how to incorporate feminist values in ones work as well as being held accountable by others for that work.
</p>
<p>
<b>“I care about sharing more and hoarding less – holding space for different perspectives, also and especially beyond gender."</b> - Hera Hussein
</p>


<p>
With Chayns new field guide to advance survivor-centric interventions to tech facilitated gender violence - <a href="https://chayn.notion.site/chayn/Orbits-a-global-field-guide-to-advance-intersectional-survivor-centred-and-trauma-informed-interv-8d8dc6a1436543b8b25af63ddafaa409/">Orbits</a> - Hera and her collegues are creating exactly those kind of spaces. The purpose of the guide is to source information on how to embed a survior-centered and trauma informed approach regarding gender violence to critical areas like research, technology development and policy. It offers examples, best practices and strategies, but also open questions – for which a feminist perspective could help to find some answers.
</p>
<p>
Using a feminist approach to find answers is also a daily practice for Michelle Thorne. At Mozilla she unpacks the complexities of the internet and its connection to the climate crisis. “The internet is the largest coal powered machine that we have” Michelle stated on the panel, which amounts to more than 3% of global carbon emissions - more than that of aviation or the shipping industry. Looking through an intersectional prism, it is clear that the climate crisis disproportionately affects women, girls, and people in vulnerable communities.Therefore, the impact of the Internet on the environment must be front and center if we are to achieve a sustainable and equitable future.
</p>

<p>
<b>““How can we trasition the interent away from fossile fuels while advocating for a just and sustainable internet – that’s a feminist question of our time!”</b> - Michelle Thorne
</p>
<p>
Aiming for such a goal includes making sure big tech takes its climate neutrality pledges seriously, since they are “moving big into green washing”. Moreover, selling the status quo powered by green energy as an improvement will not solve the digital rights issues on online plattforms or the harassment of women sustainability leaders in the online space. Hence, while campaigning for a fossile free internet, we need to advance open and sustainable digital alternatives at the same time, since everything is interlinked.
