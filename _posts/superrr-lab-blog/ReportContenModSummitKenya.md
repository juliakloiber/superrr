In 2019 Daniel Motaung, content moderator at Sama by that time, was in the process of formally filing trade union papers when he got fired.
Five  years later, on May 1st 2023, 150 moderators from different platforms gather in a conference room at the Mövenpick Hotel in Nairobi to collectively fight for better working conditions.It's the largest gathering of content moderators ever to take place. The date – Labour Day – is well chosen. After arriving and signing in at the registration desk, the participants move on to a wall with three names on it: “Platform Workers Union”, “Content Moderators Union”, and “Content Protectors Union”. Sticky notes mark the favourite name choice.

<p>
That’s why, on the March 9-10, we are proud to be co-hosting a landmark content moderator summit in Berlin, alongside our partners <a href="https://www.foxglove.org.uk/">Foxglove</a>, German union ver.di and <a href="https://aspirationtech.org/">Aspiration</a>.
</p>
<p>
This will be the first ever gathering of social media content moderators from across Germany. Forty or so content moderators from multiple social media companies will connect and develop relationships with organisers, policymakers, and lawyers, to build collective power and demand better pay and working conditions at Facebook, TikTok, YouTube and more.
</p>
<p>
The summit is the first step towards building an international network of moderators working across the world for the various social media companies. It is the culmination of years of work by workers, unions and civil society groups to establish and strengthen relationships of trust between tech workplaces and, eventually, across national borders.
</p>
<p>
Moderators will discuss what needs to change to make moderation work safe, fair and valued. They will also meet with politicians and political parties in Germany and Europe to discuss what they can do to support them. 
</p>
<p>
Content moderators’ work is global work, affecting workers and social media audiences worldwide. Reflecting that, the Berlin summit will be the first of three content moderator summits in the pipeline, which will be held around the world. 
</p>
<p>
The Berlin summit is just one part of a rising tide of worker power taking the fight to Big Tech, alongside the <a href="https://mmm.verdi.de/medienwirtschaft/tiktok-hat-erstmals-einen-betriebsrat-84757">newly founded works council at TikTok Germany </a> and former content moderator <a href="https://time.com/6253180/meta-kenya-lawsuit-motaung/">Daniel Motaung’s lawsuit against Facebook</a> and their outsourcing company Sama in Kenya. Workers are realising the power they hold, working together and taking back control.
