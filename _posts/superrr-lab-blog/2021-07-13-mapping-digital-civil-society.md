<p>Now also in English: Our <a href="https://www.goethe.de/resources/files/pdf228/gi-mapping-digitale-zivilgesellschaft_en1.pdf">Mapping of Digital Civil Society</a> in Germany. But what exactly is digital civil society?</p>

<p>For this, we have developed a definition as part of the report: 

Digital Civil Society is made up of social movements, collectives or organisations that:
<ul>
<li> Provide free access to digital technologies, to digitally available data and knowledge or to the internet for the common good,</li>
<li> Enable participation, e.g. by providing platforms, but also through youth education, further education and training in media, digital and technological skills,</li>
<li> Develop technologies for the common good (public interest),</li>
<li> Reveal the impact of digital technologies on society, or</li>
<li> Promote and help shape digital policy issues.</li>
</ul>
</p>
