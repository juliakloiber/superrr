title: Watch now â€“ 10 Propositions for Claiming Better Futures 
description: Re-watch the recording of our closing event for The New New Fellowship online
---

<p>We wondered: how can we find a suitable closing for the first The New New Fellowship round? How can we pay tribute to the inspiring times we had, the discussions we learned from and the exciting journeys the fellows are taking.</p>
<p>Our answer: with inspiration and thought-provoking perspectives on better futures by the fellows and external guests! We invited a group of visionaries to share ideas, imaginations, and interventions for better futures. We asked each speaker to share their propositions within 3 minutes.
We heard about a feminist digital infrastructure fund by <a href="https://twitter.com/jhybe?lang=de">Jac sm Kee</a>, inclusive game design by <a href="https://internetteapot.com/">Internet Teapot</a>, the Romnja feminist archive by <a href="https://www.romnja-power.de/">RomaniPhen</a>, about <a href="https://thenewnew.space/projects/la-banlieue-du-turfu/">banlieues and the future</a>, or how to build tech resilience against domestic abuse by <a href="https://thenewnew.space/projects/building-tech-resilience-against-domestic-abuse-in-italy/">Chayn Italia</a>, and many more.</p>

<p>We are superrr happy that we can share the recordings with you to enjoy the talks in case you missed the event! Watch it here:</p>
