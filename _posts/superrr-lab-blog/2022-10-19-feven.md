<p><em>We are very excited to announce a new addition to our team! ✨ Feven will lead SUPERRRs communication and community work.</em></p>

<p><b>SUPERRR:</b> A good way to get to know someone is via their side projects and hobbies. What are some of your current side projects, Feven?
</p>
<p><b>Feven:</b> Music has always been a powerful tool for distributing knowledge and powerful ideas to me. Right now, I'm working on the first volume of "project: tapeshifta," a small project born out of a necessity, desire, and an attempt to chronicle the revolutionary tradition and beauty of Eritrean and North East African Music. The main aim of tapeshifta is to introduce the wider public (esp. the North East African diaspora) to a digitized cultural archive by converting cassette tapes to mp3. The first post highlights Tsehaytu Beraki, an Eritrean musician and woman freedom fighter. You can check it out <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CZiFAPHMl4I/">here</a>. I also work as an editor, podcast host and creative producer. In my free time, I enjoy collecting music/singing/hiking/reading/being a digital hermit.
</p>

<p><b>SUPERRR:</b> With Superrr Lab we are thinking a lot about the future(s). What is an object/or application that does not yet exist – but something that you would like to have at your disposal in a preferable digital future? Something you would use every day and cannot imagine living without?
</p>
<p><b>Feven:</b> I always thought some of the devices that Starfleet personnel use are very practical - the Holodeck, for example. I don't know if you're familiar with its concept; the Holodeck is an apparatus that enables holographic projections customizable to the user's wishes, i.e., meaning that the machine simulates any situation regardless of space and time. I, for one, would like to travel to some pivotal moments of (pre-)human history; maybe a little ride out in Pangaea for example, hahahahaha! </p>
  
<p><b>SUPERRR:</b> What's your biggest energy sucker these days?</p>

<p><b>Feven:</b> It was definitely some of the (reactionary) tendencies and currents on social media for a while. Now, I log off and disengage as soon as I feel the negativity creeping up.</p>

<p><b>SUPERRR:</b> What is a small humble change you would like to see in the world? How can we work towards it?</p>

<p><b>Feven:</b> A small humble change? If everyone listened to some Stevie Wonder, the world would be a tiny bit better. No joke. He is a force of joy.</p>

<p><b>SUPERRR:</b> What communities are you part of?</p>

<p><b>Feven:</b> I consider myself part of the Eritrean diaspora first and foremost; Black feminist spaces - on and offline - have also been a place I call home.</p>

<p><b>SUPERRR:</b> Things we should all read/know about! Please share three of your favorite projects, texts, links, inspirations with us:

<p><b>SUPERRR:</b> Last but not least, what's your favourite Meme?</p>
<p><b>Feven:</b> Although I described myself as a digital hermit earlier, I very much am chronically online. But I love to be in my own little world while doing so. Hence, „hermit. “ 
That being said, Black Twitter creates the funniest memes, so naturally, some of my favorite memes are tweets. Here are some of them:
