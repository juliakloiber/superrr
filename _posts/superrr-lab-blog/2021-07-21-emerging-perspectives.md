<p>Who thinks about futures, who doesn’t, and why is it important to reflect on the divergent dynamics in academia, arts, tech and beyond? Superrr Lab warmly invites you to join the digital workshop „Thinking of Futures: On (e)merging perspectives“ on the 18th of August. We will merge academic, community-oriented and social justice perspectives and practices and discuss emerging critical and alternative approaches to designing just and equal futures. The workshop is created as a space to critically reflect on racist, patriarchal, sexist and colonial continuities in futures thinking. It is a place for exchange on disrupting (digital) practices from civil society.
We are excited to announce Franziska Schönfeld (<a href="https://www.zukunftsforscherin.de/">zukunftsforscherin.de</a>), Makan Fofana, Hugo Pilate (Banlieue du Turfu) and Camila Nobrega (Beyond the Green), who will share insights from their respective work. All participants will have the opportunity to discuss the presented topics and overarching questions afterwards.
