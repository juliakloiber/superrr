<p><em>We are thrilled to announce that we have a new team member! ✨ Larissa just joined SUPERRR Lab and will help visualize our work on a feminist tech policy. To introduce and welcome him, we've asked him a couple of questions: </em></p>

<p><b>SUPERRR:</b> A good way to get to know someone is via their side projects and hobbies. What are some of your current side projects, Larissa?</p>
<p><b>Larissa:</b> Side projects love to live in my brain, occupy space and then vanish when more side projects get stuffed in! No, but  right now I am keen on researching for my bachelor thesis – which also includes playing some video games. Lucky me! I’m right in the middle of planning to design and program a video game, which means a lot of drawing, designing, and coding!</p>

<p><b>SUPERRR:</b> With Superrr Lab we are thinking a lot about the future(s). What is an object/or application that does not yet exist – but something that you would like to have at your disposal in a preferable digital future?
Something you would use every day and cannot imagine living without?
</p>
<p><b>Larissa:</b> A quicksave function. Am I about to do something risqué? Quicksave. Trying something out that may end in disaster? Save status to maybe reload later. I think I’d love this application, yet life would be very boring without some risk!</p>
  
<p><b>SUPERRR:</b> What's your biggest energy sucker these days?</p>

<p><b>Larissa:</b> Figuring out how to settle in! I recently moved to Berlin to work with SUPERRR, so as exciting it is, getting to know your way around a new city is a bit draining. Especially if the city is the biggest busiest one you’ve ever lived in! </p>

<p><b>SUPERRR:</b> What is a small humble change you would like to see in the world? How can we work towards it?</p>

<p><b>Larissa:</b> If people could see how speech impacts other people and their lives. Not talking necessarily about hateful speech or anything similar, but how wording a sentence can make a big difference. Positively expressing yourself, showing gratitude and empowerment does change a lot. </p>

<p><b>SUPERRR:</b> Things we should all read/know about! Please share three of your favorite projects, texts, links, inspirations with us:</p>

<p><b>Larissa:</b> 
<ul><li><a href="https://girlswhocode.com/">Girlswhocode!</a>Coding, especially women in coding, is a big interest of mine. Retelling the history of coding and giving credit to all the amazing people that contributed to it. Reshaping the image, of what a person who codes looks like. The numbers of women in coding is declining, so this platforms mission is reaching girls around the world and are on track to close the gender gap in new entry-level tech jobs by 2030.</li>

<li><p>•The game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1102130/Florence/">Florence!</a>! Even if you have never ever played a single video game – this one you gotta play! Maybe it is because the protagonist is a woman in her mid 20s, confused about where to go in life and going through love and breakup and rediscovering her passions I love this game so much, or because of the insanely cool style and game mechanics. Well, overall it’s an incredible experience!</p></li>


<p><b>SUPERRR:</b> Last but not least, what's your favourite Meme?</p>
<p><b>Larissa:</b> Ah I am actually a meme librarian. I collect them and send my friends curated memes of the week. If I had to choose a meme that I do enjoy throughout the times, it may be these two:

<p><b>SUPERRR:</b> Thank you so much Larissa, and once again: Welcome on board!</p>
