  <em>Join us for an hour of thought-provoking proposals on diverse and inclusive digital futures: October 7th, 6pm-7:15pm CET, online</em>
  </p>

<p> 
  Imagine what would happen if all the propositions we make today were to be realized tomorrow? Which grievances would we center, which people and their realities would we focus on, and how sustainable and holistic would our solutions be then? What would be different?
  </p>

<p> 
For the closing event of The New New fellowship we have invited around of visionaries to share ideas, imaginations and interventions for better futures with us. During this event we will hear thought-provoking proposals, thinking along technical, political, artistic-cultural, environment and social lines. The speakers will have 3 minutes each to present their proposition. We are looking forward to welcoming you!
