                    Superrr is a community and a lab. We develop visions and projects with the goal to create more equitable futures. We do so by researching technologies, building networks and shaping new narratives. Superrr is playful, visionary and feminist.

                    The mission of Superrr Lab is to explore and develop the potentials of new technologies for society and diversity. We work on research and advocacy projects with a broad range of people and institutions – From policy makers to artists, non-profits, public institutions and others. Through our fellowship programs we support individuals and explore future narratives. In our research work we study the social implications of technology. In our advocacy work we challenge the power and purpose of technology in society. Our work is driven by feminist values such as equity, diversity, creativity and curiosity.
                    Superrr Lab is an independent non-profit organization founded by Elisa Lindinger and Julia Kloiber in 2019.

                    Superrr Community is a lose network of female, trans and non-binary people in the arts, in science, tech, journalism, activism and more. People who challenge the status quo by the work they do – through starting new programs and organizations, running campaigns, creating community spaces or developing and building things that try to make the world a better place. We strive for diversity, fairness and equality. We believe that we can best achieve that by working together and by empowering and supporting one another. We meet on a regular basis to come together, exchange new ideas and scheme on new collaborations. We combine our forces to fight for a free society in which everyone can live up to their potentials.
                    <br><br>The Superrr community was started in 2015 by Zara Rahman and Julia Kloiber. Kat Braybrooke and Frederike Kaltheuner run the Superrr community in London.
